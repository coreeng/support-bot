ticket_id	Driver	Category	Feature	Summary
10000	Product Temporary Issue	CI	GHA, Build environment, runners	Multiple tenants stated widespread process failures across numerous repositories due to inability to acquire GitHub Actions runners during NFT launches and extended test runs, with errors stating jobs were not acquired by runners even after numerous attempts. The infrastructure team recognized that these failures were caused by a substantial GitHub outage that occurred during the affected time period and was resolved by GitHub, indicating this was an external dependency problem rather than a platform setup or capacity challenge.
10001	Product Temporary Issue	Tenancy & Onboarding	tenancy management	"The customer's build failed with a 401 issue stating ""unable to determine team name from repository"" after renaming their code repository from id-personas to id-persona-management and updating the tenant configuration in dpe-platform-config. The support team verified that the tenant resource had been successfully deployed to the cluster with the updated repository name, and the problem resolved itself once the configuration changes were fully applied, indicating a momentary synchronization delay between the setup update and cluster rollout."
10002	Knowledge Gap	CI	Artifactory, Artifact Store	The tenant observed periodic 403 errors when downloading Gradle distributions during canary deployments, with builds failing because services.gradle.org redirects to GitHub where WAF rules occasionally block requests deemed suspicious. The user was unaware that the platform provides an internal Artifactory pull-through cache for Gradle distributions to avoid these GitHub WAF blocks, and had missed communications about switching their gradle-wrapper.properties distributionUrl from services.gradle.org to the platform's Artifactory instance, though docs had been updated with the recommended URL.
10003	Knowledge Gap	Configuring Platform Features	Kafka as a service	The user came across an issue while enabling a new component and initially sought the platform engineers to verify whether Kafka ACL changes from many PRs to the kaas-platform code repository had been deployed to production. The tenant resolved the issue independently after discovering the source of the matter was on their side, indicating they initially misattributed the complication to platform installation status rather than their own config.
10004	Knowledge Gap	CD	Pipeline shapes	"The client's cdDeployDev phase was not executing their defaultTaskExecution script as expected, showing only ""No pre-script defined"" instead of running the deployment logic they had defined inline in their cd.yml setup. The support team explained that the ""No pre-script defined"" message referred to an optional pre-execution script rather than the default task itself, and recommended moving the script to an in-repo file and referencing it, which resolved the matter and allowed the CoreIngress release to proceed successfully."
10005	Knowledge Gap	CI	Pipeline shapes	The user wanted to pass a specific path value to the cdBuild.sh script in the build-release-shape reusable job sequence to enable concurrent job execution per area/team/env, but was unsure how to pass environment variables to the reusable workflow. The infrastructure team steered the tenant to use workflow parameters as the recommended approach, providing an example from the core-platform source repository, which corrected successfully the matter.
10006	Knowledge Gap	Deploying & Configuring Tenant Applications	workload compute	The user inquired how to request dedicated nodes with node affinity/taints and whether they could configure specific terminationGracePeriodSeconds values different from the default 30 seconds. The platform engineers explained that dedicated node pools are not generally available (only a special case exists for non-routable nodes for one tenant), that terminationGracePeriodSeconds is a standard Kubernetes pod spec field tenants can configure freely in their release manifests, and that ClusterAutoscaler enforces a maximum 10-minute wait before forceful termination during node scale-down.
10007	Product Temporary Issue	CI	GHA, Build environment, runners	Various pipelines failed with irregular 504 errors when downloading JFrog CLI binaries from releases.jfrog.io, an external dependency used in DPE base workflows for phase-lock functionality. The infrastructure team verified this was a known challenge where traffic gets flagged as suspicious by third-party WAF policies, causing unauthenticated downloads to fail temporarily, and recommended rerunning failed jobs while tracking a longer-term solution to move the resource to Artifactory and enable dependency caching.
10008	Product Temporary Issue	CI	GHA, Build environment, runners	Numerous workflows failed during NFT launches with 502 and 504 errors when downloading JFrog CLI for obtaining pipeline locks, affecting several repositories. The support team validated this was a known situation where traffic gets flagged as suspicious by third-party WAF policies when downloading from releases.jfrog.io, causing irregular unauthenticated download failures, and guided the team to track progress via a backlog card addressing the issue for all tenants.
10009	Knowledge Gap	Monitoring & Troubleshooting Tenant Applications	None	The user had an old link to their gst-data-dbt tenant logs that was returning a 502 problem and was unsure how to access GCP logs for their service using the current logging platform. The infrastructure team furnished a Datadog query filtering by service name and cloud provider that successfully returned the tenant's GCP logs, resolving the concern.
10010	Knowledge Gap	Configuring Platform Features	Ingress (CoreIngress, Feed Ingress)	The tenant sought a summary of the CoreIngress migration status because the documentation page page was several months out of date and they had lost track of the current migration state. The team solved without assistance by finding a recent Slack thread with updated information before the support team needed to respond.
10011	Knowledge Gap	Configuring Platform Features	Ingress (CoreIngress, Feed Ingress)	The tenant sought clarification on whether there was a platform plan to deprecate additionalDomains in CoreIngress resources and migrate exclusively to canonical main ingress domains. The infrastructure team outlined that additionalDomains are entirely under user control and discretion, offered to support existing domain patterns, and can be removed once clients migrate to the standard canonical domains generated by the platform.
10012	Knowledge Gap	Deploying & Configuring Tenant Applications	application autoscaling	The tenant was testing CoreScaler settings with a specialized Prometheus query based on TPS rate to scale their google-adapter service, but believed the scaler was not scaling up despite metrics exceeding the configured threshold. The customer fixed on their own after discovering the primary cause of why pods were not scaling, which occurred after the platform engineers noted that resources had been deleted from the namespace at the end of the stubbed-NFT run to save costs.
10013	Task Request	Tenancy & Onboarding	None	The client sought the platform engineers to review and merge two pending PRs in top-terraform-datadog and top-azure-manager repositories that had been waiting since a specific date, and subsequently needed the support team to grant access to DPE resources after the PRs were merged. The platform engineers verified the delay, processed both PRs, and resolved the access situation, as these tasks required infrastructure team authority to complete.
10014	Knowledge Gap	CI	GHA, Build environment, runners	The team sought clarification on whether BuildKit version 0.12+ and Docker syntax 1.7+ were supported in the platform's container image building environment to use the --parent flag in COPY commands. The support team specified that while buildctl v0.12.3 is available in platform base images, the buildx version (v0.7.0) may not support the --parent flag, and advised the tenant either use buildctl directly or customize their agent image with a newer buildx version if needed.
10015	Task Request	Configuring Platform Features	Kafka as a service	The client sought clarification on for critical review of a PR in the kaas-platform repo, acknowledging they were skipping the normal process because the PR was blocking their delivery. This required support team authority to review and approve the Kafka setup changes.
10016	Product Usability Problem	CI	GHA, Build environment, runners	The tenant faced out-of-memory errors during the test reports collection step when building a TypeScript module with large node_modules directories, and upgrading to a larger runner did not resolve the matter. The platform engineers discovered that the test report step was traversing the entire directory tree with wildcard patterns, and while the client could work around the issue by setting dummy paths for all test report keys to disable the feature, the infrastructure team admitted this was non-intuitive and committed to providing a simpler way to disable test reporting without requiring dummy path configurations.
10017	Product Temporary Issue	CI	GHA, Build environment, runners	The tenant's GitHub Actions runner failed to start with an unhealthy phase status during pipeline execution. The infrastructure team determined this was a known matter in the tools.cosmic.sky cluster where GHA runner pods take up to 4.5 minutes to become available during peak periods around 9:30 AM and 6:30 PM due to cluster scaling delays, with the customer's pod taking 5 minutes to start during a busy time when 75 nodes were being added, causing the pipeline to timeout waiting for the pod, and the platform engineers is actively working with AppHosting to investigate scheduling improvements.
10018	Knowledge Gap	Observability & Telemetry	None	"The chaos-engineering-tooling team observed a ""Permission denied"" malfunction when trying to query the MAAS server Prometheus API from within a pod, believing it was an access issue with the MAAS server. The support team found that the actual concern was that wget was attempting to save the response to a file in the current directory where the user lacked write permissions, and indicated using the -O flag to redirect output to stdout or a writable location like /tmp."
10019	Task Request	Tenancy & Onboarding	None	The customer sought the support team to review and merge a PR in the gsp-cserv-user-management-terraform code repository. This required platform engineers authority to review and approve the infrastructure settings changes.
10020	Knowledge Gap	Deploying & Configuring Tenant Applications	workload compute	The client's pod was killed during a pipeline run and they were unable to find malfunction logs explaining why the container stopped. The platform engineers helped identify through Kubernetes events that the pod was evicted due to the node running low on ephemeral storage, and advised the tenant to set ephemeral storage resource requests to prevent future evictions by ensuring proper node placement.
10021	Knowledge Gap	CI	Pipeline shapes	The tenant's pipeline job was stuck waiting for hours and they wanted to insert a briefer timeout to avoid the situation. The support team explained that the job was queued behind many concurrent builds competing for the same phase lock (cdStubbedNft), caused by the team's push trigger starting a build on every commit, and recommended removing the push trigger to only build on pull requests, or disabling phase locks if exclusive namespace access is not needed.
10022	Task Request	CI	GHA, Build environment, runners	The customer noticed their Jenkins slave had been missed during the broader migration of slaves to GitHub runners and requested information about for assistance to migrate it, asking if there was an existing migration script, documentation page, or standard process to follow. The infrastructure team ran the migration script and merged a PR to complete the migration, as this required support team authority to execute the migration tooling and deploy the changes to the tools cluster.
10023	Knowledge Gap	Security & Compliance	Kafka as a service	The tenant was accessing a Kafka Prometheus federate endpoint and experienced Snyk security warnings about the self-signed certificate not being trusted by a CA, asking if there was a way to get CA-trusted certificates. The messaging team detailed that the infrastructure-only domain uses self-signed certificates by design, that the team should continue using the existing prometheus federate addresses, and that migration to signed certificates is planned for the future but not yet available, requiring the tenant to raise a Snyk exception in the meantime.
10024	Product Usability Problem	Security & Compliance	secrets sync	The user was attempting to manually sync secrets from Vault to Kubernetes using the vault-sync job following documentation, but faced 403 errors when using the Vault address documented in the platform guides. The platform engineers found that the guide referenced an outdated Vault address, and the problem was resolved by switching to the correct regional Vault address, leading to a documentation update PR to prevent future confusion for other tenants.
10025	Task Request	Tenancy & Onboarding	tenancy management	The tenant inquired about the platform engineers to approve a PR in the dpe-platform-config code repository that was blocking their onboarding process, concerned it may have been missed during the support team's review cycle. This required infrastructure team authority to review and approve the customer parameters changes.
10026	Knowledge Gap	Tenancy & Onboarding	None	The tenant sought help to get approval and merge PRs for adding new accounts for admin access in Azure management and user management repositories. An automated reminder informed the tenant that there is no need to request reviews unless it's an emergency, as the relevant groups automatically receive notifications and aim to review PRs within 24 hours per SLA, indicating the customer was unaware of the standard PR review process and job sequence.
10027	Knowledge Gap	CI	GHA, Build environment, runners	The tenant's long-running pre-population workflows in GitHub Actions were failing after approximately 12 hours with kubectl authentication errors, occurring consistently around 5-6 AM. The platform engineers specified that kubernetes credentials are rotated during a daily maintenance window in the early morning hours, invalidating kube auth tokens, and that the user should schedule workflows to complete before 5 AM or work around this constraint, as the kubeconfig secret is mounted into the pod and cannot be refreshed without recreating the pod.
10028	Knowledge Gap	Tenancy & Onboarding	tenancy management	The tenant questioned whether adding a repo to their customer settings needed time to take effect, as their pipeline was stalling waiting for the runner after a PR was merged to add a repository to the plutus tenant. The support team established that the user resource had been updated in the cluster and runners should be able to access the repo, and the tenant subsequently got it working.
10029	Task Request	Tenancy & Onboarding	tenancy management	The tenant petitioned for approval for a PR in the core-platform-config repo to add small permissions changes. This required platform engineers authority to review and approve the customer config changes.
