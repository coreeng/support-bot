üëÄ View and track ticket statuses.

‚öôÔ∏è Update and manage ticket states (open, closed).

üö® Mark tickets as escalated when requiring specialist attention.

‚≠ê Collect instant feedback on support threads ‚Äî upon ticket closure, the thread creator can rate their support experience directly in Slack.

üìä Store support metrics in a database for dashboards and analytics.

üìã Browse and filter tickets from the in-Slack Bot Homepage ‚Äî view a dashboard of tickets and quickly filter by status, impact, or assigned team, all without leaving Slack.

## üì¶ Installation

## Running locally

To run the Support-Bot locally, please refer to [the service README](https://github.com/coreeng/support-bot/blob/main/api/service/README.md) for instructions.

## Running within a Kubernetes Cluster

Follow these steps to deploy the Support-Bot in a Kubernetes environment:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Dockerfile

Create a `Dockerfile` that uses our base image. You can reference the image below:

```
ghcr.io/coreeng/support-bot:<latestVersionFromRegistry>
```
 
* Replace `<latestVersionFromRegistry>` with the latest version
* For a full list of available versions, see the [package registry](https://github.com/coreeng/support-bot/pkgs/container/support-bot)

```Dockerfile
# Dockerfile example
FROM ghcr.io/coreeng/support-bot:0.0.48
# Optional: add custom config/commands
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Database

A `Postgres` database is required for the application to function. Ensure your cluster has a running
Postgres instance and that the Support-Bot can connect to it. The Support-Bot will run database migrations on startup.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Application Configuration

We recommend mounting your custom configuration as a Kubernetes `ConfigMap`.

* The default config can be found [here](https://github.com/coreeng/support-bot/blob/main/api/service/src/main/resources/application.yaml)
* An example of custom config definition can be found [here](https://github.com/coreeng/support-bot/blob/main/api/k8s/service/values.yaml#L118)
* An example of how the config is mounted can be found [here](https://github.com/coreeng/support-bot/blob/main/api/k8s/service/templates/deployment.yaml#L58)

For example, to override the enums configuration, replace the enums block in your custom config.

For a more detailed explanation of all configuration options see the [Configuration Documentation](https://github.com/coreeng/support-bot/blob/main/api/service/docs/configuration.md)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

For the application to function correctly, you will need to set the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SLACK_TOKEN` | Slack bot token |
| `SLACK_SOCKET_TOKEN` | Websocket token for Slack events |
| `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` | Slack signing secret |
| `SLACK_TICKET_CHANNEL_ID` | Slack channel ID where queries arrive |

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Identity Provider

The Support-Bot integrates with an **Identity Provider** to fetch member details.  
An Identity Provider is a prerequisite for the bot to function.  
More details under `platform-integration` in the [configuration docs](https://github.com/coreeng/support-bot/blob/main/api/service/docs/configuration.md).
